    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It is syntactically similar to the ABC programming language, and its language concept structure is also influenced by Modula, Pascal, and Algol 68. Python supports many programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, functional, and scripting. It is also widely used as a web development language with frameworks like Django and Flask.
        Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language. It was named after the British comedy group Monty Python. The language's official mascot is a cartoon of the Pythonidae family of snakes.</p>
