    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) was developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The language was originally called SEQUEL, which was an abbreviation for structured English query language. The name was later shortened to SQL. 
        The first version of SQL was designed to retrieve and manipulate data from IBM's System R database. The language was based on Edgar Frank Codd's 1970 paper, “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks”. 
        SQL was standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. It has since become the most widely used language for managing relational databases</p>
